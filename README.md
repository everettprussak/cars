type the number 1 to enter a new car
type the number 2 to display the list of cars
type the number 3 to quit and exit the program
 
If the user chooses to enter a car they will be prompted separately for the:
Year

Model
These values will be combined into a single string with the values separated by colons (:) and appended to the My_old_cars file
 

If the user chooses to list the cars

If the user chooses to Quit
The program will display a “Goodbye” message and exit.
